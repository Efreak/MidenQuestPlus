A few enhancements for MidenQuest

# How to install-
Install a userscript extension such as greasemonkey or tampermonkey:
Click here: http://tampermonkey.net

Then, click this link to install the script:

If you get a bunch of code instead of it installing, you can copy and paste the code as a new script in greasemonkey/tampermonkey.
